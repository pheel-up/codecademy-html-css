Codecademy HTML & CSS Lesson Notes

HyperText = text with links in it

Markup Language = programming language used to make text do more than just sit
  on a page.
  --It can turn text into:
    -images
    -links
    -tables
    -lists

CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
  Skin and makeup that covers the bones of HTML.

Things inside <> are tags

There are always two parts to an HTML file:
  -Head
    --Info about HTML file
      +Title = what is seen in browser title bar
  -Body
    --Text, Images, and Links

There are 6 heading tags: h1-h6

Give tags more instructions by including attributes in the opening tag. An
attribute is simply a characteristic or some description for the content in the
element. You saw this with src in <img> and href in <a>.

Fonts style: <p style = "font-size:14px; color: orange; font-family: Bodoni">
  --can be used for paragraphs, headings, and links
  a. font-size: 14px
  b. color: orange
  c. font-family: Bodoni
