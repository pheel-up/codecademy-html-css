        These are some random thoughts

            My tasteless comment was insensitive and misplaced. I apologize and
            hope its deletion will enforce the sincerity of my apology.
          </li>
          <li>I am sorry. I wouldn't have weighed in with my point of view if i
            hadn't experienced sexual abuse in the past. The only way i have
            dealt is to belittle the perpetrator in my mind with humor.
          </li>

            It was a deeply personal, painful, and emotional experience.  It
            was by no means humorous when it was occurring.  I have only learned
            to use humor as a tool to cope after the fact.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learned from this conversation that sexual abuse, rape, and
            all violence for that matter is better discussed in person.  Again,
            i apologize.
